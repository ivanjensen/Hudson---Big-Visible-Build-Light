This directory contains two different build-light solutions.

1. A ruby script that parses Hudson/Jenkins json output and drives an arduino (arduino code not included)
2. A standalone arduino project that leverages a network card to poll Hudson/Jenkins directly

Standalone arduino
==================
All the code for #2 is in the src folder.

Every 20 seconds, the Arduino will make a request to the URI held in the search constant to obtain the URI 
for the Jenkin's view/build that you wish to monitor.  A second request is made to the view's URI to obtain 
the JSON status report which is processed by the Arduino to update the status LEDs.


Ruby script
===========
I use this script at work to monitor our Hudson builds (a specific view/collection of builds).

It drives an Arduino board with tonnes of LED's in it (Red and Blue) - schematic to follow one day.

Usage: monitor_builds.rb <hudson host> <path to view>
Example: ./monitor-builds.rb hudson2 product/CI
